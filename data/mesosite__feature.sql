2016-08-09 09:02:05.601585-05,4 PM 80 degrees in August ,"For Des Moines, the 4 PM temperature yesterday was just 80 degrees and as shown by the 
featured chart, this is a bit below average for the hour during the month of August. The 
chart displays the overall monthly average for 4 PM for each August on record for the site. 
A linear trend line is shown as well, which shows not much correlated change over the 
years. Warmer temperatures are in the forecast for the rest of this week, before cooling a 
bit for the weekend.","",0,0,0,t,"",10154387053744738,"","",0,png,,

2016-09-23 14:54:28.622334-05,Daily Relative Humidity ,"Relative Humidity is one of the more commonly expressed weather variables. It represents 
the percentage capacity that the air is full of water vapor. Since the value is relative, it is 
difficult to directly compare the value at different air temperatures. While the air certainly 
feels drier in the winter time, the relative humidity values are just as high as the summer 
time. The featured chart presents a computed climatology of RH for Ames. The blue bars 
represent the daily range of RH values for each day this year. The blue, green, and black 
lines are simple averages of the daily min, avg, and max. The red line represents the 
frequency of days with the maximum RH at or above 95%. A lot going on with the chart! Of 
note for this time of year is that relative humidities are dropping. Demand for water and 
subsequent transpiration by agricultural crops is on the rapid decline. You may have 
noticed the corn and soybeans are turning brown now! These lower RH values help to dry 
out the fields and crops to allow for harvest. ","",99,50,10,t,"",,/onsite/features/past.php,"",146,png,,
